Super duper simple react + redux app.

## What does it do?

Loads a few paragraphs of [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/json-api/) through their api and lets the user add 
comments to the story.

Nothing is stored anywhere so each refresh resets the app.

## Thats it?

Yup. I'm just learning practicing redux and react.

## Got some resources?
